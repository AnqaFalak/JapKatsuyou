In this application, we want to afford as many features as we can, to help the Japanese language learner conjugating Japanese verbs.
These are features afforded in this application's version:
<ul>
<li><a href="#search">Verb search and conjugation</a></li>
<li><a href="#save">Content Export and Print</a></li>
<li><a href="#zoom">Zooming</a></li>
<li><a href="#pref">Preferences</a></li>
<li><a href="#help">Help</a></li>
<li><a href="#tray">Close to tray</a></li>
</ul>
<b>If you want some other features</b>, contact us on our user group mailing list:
<a href="mailto:dzcoding@googlegroups.com" >dzcoding@googlegroups.com</a>
<br>
Or, You can participate directly in our Github repository:

</p>


<h2 id="search">Verb search and conjugation</h2>
<p>
If you want to test a verb's existence, you can just input it in its dictionary form, then conjugate it.
If it is found you can see its type and conjugation. 
Otherwise, you will get a message telling you that the verb doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
Remember, the verb must be in the dictionary form (or U-Form). 
For example, 食べる, 飲む, 行く, 信じる, 死ぬ, 見る, 泳ぐ, 遊ぶ, 出す, 立つ, 合う, etc.
Also, you can conjugate nouns which take the verb する as an auxiliary, and form a verb. 
For example, 勉強する, 選択する, 連絡する, etc.
In fact, it is just the conjugation of the verb する.
After entering the verb, you can either press ENTER key (on keyboard), or push "Conjugate button".
</p>

<p>
The conjugation result is grouped into three tables. 
The classification is based on the complexity of the conjugation, and the use case.
</p>
<h4>1- Standard conjugation</h4>
<img src="gui_standard.jpg" alt="" >
<p>
It is used by Japanese learners to remember the conjugation of verbs. 
If you want to learn verb conjugation as Japanese people do, this is the right choice for you.
</p>

<h4>2- Basic conjugation</h4>
<img src="gui_basic.jpg" alt="" >
<p>
Almost the same as "Standard conjugation", but it includes T-Form. 
This type of conjugation afford the different stems which are combined with other suffixes to get more complex forms.
These forms are: Imperfective, Hypothetical, Imperative, Conjunctive, Terminal, and Attributive.

</p>

<h4>3- Complex conjugation</h4>
<img src="gui_complex.jpg" alt="" >
<p>
The complex forms are generated from the basic forms followed by suffixes.
The complex conjugation follow three axes:
<ol>
<li>Conjugation Form: the tense or case in which the verb is conjugated. For example: Present, Past, Imperative, Volitional, etc.</li>
<li>Conjugation Politness: Polite or Plain.</li>
<li>Conjugation Polarity: Positive or Negative.</li>
</ol>
When combined, they form a complex conjugation.
For example:
<ul>
<li>Present polite and affirmative = Conjunctive (I-Form) + suffix (ます)</li>
<li>Past plain and negative = Imperfective (A-Form) + suffix (なかった)</li>
<li>Conditional plain and affirmative = Conjunctive (T-Form) + suffix (たら)</li>
<li>Present Continuous polite and negative = Conjunctive (T-Form) + suffix (ていません)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="save">Content Export and Print</h2>
